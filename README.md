# Gyver’s Enchantment Crafting

This addon addresses issues with Villager-based Librarian farms for enchanted books. Building a villager trading farm encourages exploitation of human-like neutral villagers, and development of these farms for the variety of mid to late game enchantments will be made even more time consuming and out of reach for casual players.

This addon also addresses issues with the existing randomization of enchantments with the current enchanting table system, providing a path to enchanted books with specific enchantments to use on equipment.

I’ve been playtesting this myself on my server at home and it feels a lot like potion making on steroids. Keeping the resources on hand for all the enchantments will be something that most people probably won’t want to have to mess with, but most people don’t necessarily want to build a villager trading hall either. I believe that those who want to do their own thing will continue to do so with this addon, as well as those that don’t want to mess with anything but just buying enchanted books will continue to do so. If anything, I could see this addon providing multiplayer trading opportunities for recipe materials that otherwise wouldn’t exist.

I have done some minor trading with some farmers at a nearby village to acquire enough emeralds to create a Looting III enchanted book, but other than that, I’ve not needed to interact with any villagers.

## Wandering Trader
Wandering Trader sells random sets of books that provide in-game materials to acquire the knowledge about the recipes below. They’re a nice piece of lore to acquire and display in your enchanting room for those so inclined.

## Enchantment Crafting Table
Made in the standard crafting table.

## Enchantment Crafting recipes
Requiring Lapis and books for recipes adds additional multiplayer trade opportunities for both Lapis and unenchanted books. Time spent collecting these resources, plus the variety of recipe items far outweighs the time required to level up several villagers to perform mass trades with them for emeralds. Raid farms make it even easier to acquire emeralds.
